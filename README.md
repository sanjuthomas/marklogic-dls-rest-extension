If you are in this page you already know that MarkLogic DLS Libraries are currently not exposed via REST.
(https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/dls) DLS REST Extensions may be added into MarkLogic in the future.
Until then you may use this as a reference implementation.

This is a work in progress and I planning to complete this by end of July 2017. Btw nothing official about this.
