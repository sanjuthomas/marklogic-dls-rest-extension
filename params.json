  "body": "# What is MarkLogic Document Library Service?\r\n\r\nThe Library Services enable you to create and maintain versions of managed documents in MarkLogic Server. Access to managed documents is controlled using a check-out/check-in model. For more details refer to MarkLogic official documentation [here](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/dls).\r\n\r\n# What is MarkLogic DLS REST Extension?\r\n\r\nYou are here because you already know that, as of today, the DLS XQuery APIs are not exposed via REST in MarkLogic. You may use this project as a reference implementation to expose the DLS XQuery functions via REST.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Testing\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sanjuthomas/marklogic-dls-rest-extension.git\r\n\r\ncd marklogic-dls-rest-extension\r\n\r\ngradle mlDeploy\r\n\r\nSample Requests for both read and update functions are available [here](https://github.com/sanjuthomas/marklogic-dls-rest-extension/tree/master/src/sample-requests). You may use a standard REST client like Postman to test.\r\n\r\n## What is not yet implemented?\r\nYou can find all the DLS functions exposed via the REST extension [here](https://github.com/sanjuthomas/marklogic-dls-rest-extension/blob/master/src/main/ml-modules/lib/dls-function-conf.sjs). In the current version, the optional parameter to the DLS functions are not read from the request.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nPlease contact me at ml@sanju.org if you find any issues or looking for clarification.\r\n",
